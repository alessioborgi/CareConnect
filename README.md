# Care Connect: Using LLMs to Improve Patient Care & Hospital Efficiency

This project demonstrates an AI-driven system for querying environmental data in a hospital setting, generating real-time graphs, and executing actions based on the insights obtained. The system uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT models (via LangChain) to interact with an SQLite database, create visualizations, and control hospital environmental conditions like temperature and air quality. The primary use case involves monitoring hospital rooms and rooftop sensor data, allowing staff to query information through natural language. It also provides explanation and insights on the plots that have been generated, allowing also to trigger the movement of a robot arm.
